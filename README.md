Before starting to work on this project, please create your own fork and then download the source code. I recommend to use source tree 
as UI for GIT. Though it's good if you are comfortable via cmd.

After enhancing and completing the feature, create a pull request from your fork to central repositry. This pull request must be reviewed
by reviewer(assigned by you) before merging into the central repo.
